I'm a scientist excited about interpreting measurements and making sense of high dimensional data. I care about understanding the immune system, and using what we learn about it to improve human health. 

I recently completed my PhD at Harvard Medical School. My PhD focused on methods for single cell transcriptomics and methods for analyzing single cell data.  

I'm looking for full time roles starting February 2024. I'm also available for machine learning and bioinformatics consulting. Contact by email preferred: tessa.d.green[at]proton.me
