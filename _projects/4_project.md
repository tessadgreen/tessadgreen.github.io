The project primarily used transcriptomics to investigate asthma-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). 

We used single cell transcriptomics of B cells to investigate differentiation in the sinus and found evidence of plasma cell proliferation in patients with nasal polyps.

We used time course bulk RNA-seq of the inferior turbinate to evaluate the inferior turbinate as a marker of drug response in AERD. We found that induction of aspirin desensitization increased expression of some genes associated with barrier health.
